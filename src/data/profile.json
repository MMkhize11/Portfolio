I have known him for over 4 years as a scholar and student who has risen to the heights of an employee within the technology space. This does not come as a surprise because I have watched Mpumelelo self-develop both personally and professionally, with diligence and dedication. He is a man who believes in doing, contributing and adding value. He chaired our organisation and played a critical role in helping new and young members settle into our organisation. He is not afraid to step outside his comfort zone and he likes to get things done. He is reliable and dependable and can mingle and associate with many different types of people. He is punctual and plies his trade very well in the digital and technical field. An absolute pleasure to work with and I would heartily recommend him to anyone.",
